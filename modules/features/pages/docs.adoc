= TechDocs and Search

One of the biggest challenges in software development is keeping **internal technical documentation** (as opposed to external facing customer or user documentation) fully updated. Large organizations can afford to maintain one or more technical writers whose job involves curating and maintaining technical documentation, but this is not the case in many smaller to medium sized companies.

Wikis, Sharepoint portals and other ad-hoc solutions can work in many cases, but the challenges remain to keep it updated with the rapidly evolving ecosystem of products and services in the company. You need to make it easy to write and view documentation.

RHDH TechDocs provides a low friction, easy to use documentation facility that can live right alongside the source code of the application.

The developer writes the technical documentation in simple Markdown format and stores it in version control just like any other software development artifact. RHDH renders these marked up source documents into HTML that can be viewed in RHDH. The documentation is linked and embedded into many place all over RHDH to enable ease of access.

RHDH can also auto-generate API documentation from OpenAPI/Swagger.io specs in the application

NOTE: TechDocs is not a silver bullet. You still need to inculcate a **culture** of maintaining and writing documents, especially for large software systems.

== Search

RHDH Search lets you find the right information you are looking for in RHDH. RHDH Search does not implement its own search engine, rather, it provides an interface between your RHDH instance and a search engine of your choice. RHDH search indexes many pieces of information in RHDH - catalog items, templates, documentation, and more.

By default, RHDH Search comes with an in-memory search engine implementation built on top of the open source **Lunr** search engine.

Features:

* You can integrate RHDH search with many search engines (Elasticsearch, Lunr, Solr, PostgreSQL full text search, and more).
* You can extend it by creating **collators** for indexing content from plugins and other sources.
* You can customize the look and feel of the search results.
* You can configure your own search engines by implementing and extending the Typescript APIs of RHDH.
