= Plugins

**Plugins** are modular extensions that enhance the functionality and capabilities of the platform.
They were designed to add specific features, integrations, or customizations on top of the base RHDH platform.

Plugins can provide new pages in the developer portal, new components, new APIs, new services, or even complete workflows within RHDH.
Plugins can be of three different types:

Frontend Plugins:: A static front end user interface that is written in React and TypeScript that integrates with internal or external APIs to render data in the IDP. For example, the `Tech Radar` plugin.
Backend Plugins:: A backend API that is written in TypeScript that exposes an API to frontend plugins. For example, the `Architecture Decision Record (ADR) backend` plugin.
Frontend + Backend plugins:: A mix of frontend and backend TypeScript code that provides a certain feature of functionality. For example, For example, the `ArgoCD` and `SonarQube` plugins.

Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) has a very flexible and extensive set of plugins that provide most of the functionality in the product.
The core features like Software Catalog, Templates, TechDocs and Search are themselves built as plugins in RHDH.

There are hundreds of https://backstage.io/plugins[plugins^] created by the Backstage community that you can use to customize your instance of RHDH, and adapt the IDP to your needs.

== Red Hat Supported Plugins

Red Hat actively participates in the thriving Backstage community by developing and supporting a number of useful plugins that are pre-integrated into RHDH by default.
Some of the most important ones are listed below. There are plans to develop more plugins that integrate with the Red Hat product ecosystem.

=== Tekton Plugin

The Tekton plugin enables you to visualize the results of CI/CD pipeline runs on your Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters.
The plugin allows users to visually see high level status of all associated tasks in the pipeline for their applications.

This plugin is similar to the pipeline view in the **Developer Perspective** of the OpenShift Console, and will continue to be enhanced with more features.

=== ArgoCD Plugin

This plugin allows you to visualize the ArgoCD sync status, deployment history, and health status for your GitOps enabled applications.

The ArgoCD plugin can show you the high-level status of a GitOps enabled application in your Catalog.

=== Quay.io Plugin

This plugin displays information about container images of your applications in the Quay registry.

The plugin also shows any critical vulnerabilities that were discovered while scanning the container image.

=== Keycloak Plugin

The Keycloak plugin allows RHDH to provide Single Sign-On (SSO) features for the developer portal. It maps the Keycloak user and group entities to corresponding users and groups (teams) in RHDH. Integrating with Keycloak enables the use of multiple authentication and providers, for example Social login (Google, Microsoft, Meta, Twitter/X and more), Active Directory Authentication and SAML 2.0 based identity providers, OAuth and OIDC compliant identity providers, and more.

The Keycloak backend plugin has the following capabilities:

* Synchronization of Keycloak users in a realm
* Synchronization of Keycloak groups and their users in a realm

Users and Groups from the Keycloak domain are mapped to users and groups (teams) in RHDH.

=== Topology Plugin

The Topology plugin enables you to visualize the workloads such as Deployment, Job, Daemonset, Statefulset, CronJob, and Pods for any service on your Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.
The plugin originated from the OpenShift Topology view of a project in the **Developer Perspective** UI of the OpenShift Console.

It has the following features:

* Consistent visualization of resources across Kubernetes clusters. Simplifies the process of visualizing workloads of your applications and services
* Read only access to related services of your application
* Visualize real time status of your workloads
* View related resources for your applications in the RHDH Software Catalog
* View debugging logs for your containers
* Eliminates the stress and cognitive load of accessing OpenShift or Kubernetes clusters directly via the Administrator console.
* Graphical visualization of your services and workloads, and their status across clusters in real-time, with the ability to filter workloads by a specific cluster.

Each deployment in the topology plugin can be further inspected to visualize the number of pods, their status, services, routes, and other details.

RHDH also provides a convenient link to the container logs to help developers troubleshoot application deployments without leaving RHDH.

=== Open Cluster Management (OCM) Plugin

The OCM plugin integrates your RHDH instance with Open Cluster Management (OCM) enabled clusters and displays real-time data from OCM.
It makes workloads on multiple managed clusters observable to the developer.

The OCM plugin has the following capabilities:

* All clusters represented as **ManagedCluster** in **MultiClusterHub** are discovered and imported into the RHDH Software Catalog, such as:
** Entity is defined as kind: Resource with spec.type set to kubernetes-cluster.
** Links to the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) console, OCM console, and OpenShift Cluster Manager are provided in metadata.links.

* Shows real-time data from OCM on the Resource entity page, including:
** Cluster current status (up or down)
** Cluster nodes status (up or down)
** Cluster details (console link, OCP, and Kubernetes version)
** Details about available compute resources on the cluster

RHDH can also display the Kubernetes or OpenShift clusters that your applications are deployed on, and their status.
