= Golden Path Templates

**Golden Path Templates** (GPT), also known as **Software Templates**, are pre-defined, standardized configurations and workflows that serve as a starting point for new projects or services. They are typically created and maintained by platform engineers, and consumed by developers.

GPTs typically include recommended configurations for various aspects of the application or service, such as application metadata, linters and static analysis tools, documentation, CI/CD pipelines, testing frameworks, security scanning tools and libraries, and many more features. GPTs enable true self-service for developers. They ensure consistency and adherence to organizational standards across different services or projects.

It is important to understand that GPTs should not be seen as yet another process pushed down to developers from a centralized authority. They are a way to encapsulate the various different tools, processes and utilities used in the organization and compose them together into a single tool capable of quickly scaffolding new projects, products and services of any kind. They are not meant to replace your already existing automation tools, but to complement them.

== Creating Golden Path Templates

There are three different ways to create templates:

=== Manually using YAML Files

Templates are defined in a YAML file with the **kind: Template** attribute. The template defines the set of scaffolded files, along with parameters and variables that capture input to the template.

```yaml
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: quarkus-web-template
  title: Quarkus Service with ArgoCD and a Tekton Pipeline
  description: Create a simple microservice using Quarkus with ArgoCD and a Tekton Pipeline
  tags:
    - recommended
    - java
    - quarkus
    - maven
spec:
  owner: rhdh
  type: service
  parameters:
    - title: Provide Information for Application
      required:
        - component_id
        - java_package_name
...
```

The template YAML file also describes the metadata, the source code repositories where stubbed code and configuration is stored, and a series of **steps** that describes the things that RHDH will perform to create a fully functional and deployable application or service from the template. 

These YAML files are then parsed and displayed in the Software Catalog screen of RHDH.

```yaml
steps:
    - id: template
      name: Fetch Skeleton + Template
      action: fetch:template
      input:
        url: ./skeleton
        copyWithoutRender:
          - .github/workflows/*
        values:
          component_id: ${{ parameters.component_id }}
          description: ${{ parameters.description }}
          namespace: ${{ parameters.component_id }}-dev
          group_id: ${{ parameters.group_id }}
          artifact_id: ${{ parameters.artifact_id }}
          java_package_name: ${{ parameters.java_package_name }}
          owner: ${{ user.entity.metadata.name }}
          cluster: .apps.cluster-h7z82.sandbox483.opentlc.com
          host: ${{ parameters.repo.host }}
          destination: ${{ parameters.repo.owner }}/${{ parameters.component_id }}
          quay_destination: ${{ parameters.image_organization}}/${{ parameters.component_id }}
          port: 8080

    - id: publish
      name: Publish
      action: publish:gitlab
      input:
        repoUrl: "${{ parameters.repo.host }}?owner=${{ parameters.repo.owner }}&repo=${{parameters.component_id}}"
        repoVisibility: public

    - id: register
      name: Register
      action: catalog:register
      input:
        repoContentsUrl: ${{ steps.publish.output.repoContentsUrl }}
        catalogInfoPath: "/catalog-info.yaml"
...
```

=== Dynamic Discovery using GitHub or GitLab

RHDH has a **discovery provider** for discovering catalog entities within a GitHub or GitLab organization. The provider will crawl the GitHub or GitLab organization and register entities matching a certain path. This can be useful as an alternative to statically adding templates to the catalog. This is useful for maintaining sets of related templates in Git repositories and mass import templates into new instances of RHDH in an automated manner.

For example, you can auto-discover templates in your GitLab organization by using a YAML snippet like below:

```yaml
catalog:
  locations:
    # (since 0.13.5) Scan all repositories for a catalog-info.yaml in the root of the default branch
    - type: github-discovery
      target: https://github.com/myorg
    # Or use a custom pattern for a subset of all repositories with default repository
    - type: github-discovery
      target: https://github.com/myorg/service-*/blob/-/catalog-info.yaml
    # Or use a custom file format and location
    - type: github-discovery
      target: https://github.com/*/blob/-/docs/your-own-format.yaml
    # Or use a specific branch-name
    - type: github-discovery
      target: https://github.com/*/blob/backstage-docs/catalog-info.yaml
...
```

=== Third-party Integration using API

You can also import templates into RHDH using its native Typescript APIs. This is useful in scenarios where you want to integrate with third-party systems, but it would require you to extend the RHDH Typescript API. This method is more complex than the YAML configuration methods, and is not recommended unless you have a specific need outlined above.

== Using Golden Path Templates

Developers see a list of Templates in the Software Catalog screen of RHDH. The developer chooses a template from which to instantiate the application or service, and RHDH will ask him a series of questions based on the template configuration.

For example, assume you want to create a Quarkus based REST API using a template. You will be prompted for the name of the application, some basic metadata about the application (Maven coordinates and more), details about the container image, and the Git repository where the new application source code will be scaffolded.
